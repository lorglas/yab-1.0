BUGS

yab is not totally bug free. Some bugs are well-known (see list below). 
If you encounter bugs not mentioned here, please check out the bugtracker 
at: http://yab-interpreter.sourceforge.net

Please report bugs that crashes yab itself. Note: An error message by 
yab is probably a bug in your program and not a bug in yab! 

When reporting bugs, please provide a small yab program demonstrating 
the bug, so we can fix it ASAP.

- textedit add does not harmonize with undo 
- checkbox/button image might have a memory leak
