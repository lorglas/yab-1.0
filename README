Dear Reader,

you downloaded the current snapshot of yab from SourceForge.
This repository is meant for development, potential users are 
asked to wait for the stable releases. If this does not frighten
you, please take a tour through our repository:

src: Here you will find the sources to the interpreter itself.
Read the instructions in src/README.Compile on how to compile
your own version.

BuildFactory: This is the current build factory that allows you
to compile stand alone yab applications. Use buildfactory.yab
to do so.

documentation: All documents related to yab should be here 
but, alas, some are always missing.

examples: Several yab examples help you on your first
steps in yab and to get going.

yab-IDE: The IDE written in yab itself to show the power
of yab. To run the IDE, start it, close it and then change
the default paths in: ~/config/settings/yab-ide/ide-settings

That said, have fun.

Yours

Jan
